Critical points in a Linked List
Given the head of a linked list, Find the number of critical points. (The starting and end are not considered critical points).

Local minima or maxima are called critical points.

A Node is called a local minima if both next and previous elements are greater than the current element.

A Node is called a local maxima if both next and previous elements are smaller than the current element.

Sample 1:
Input
Output
8
1 2 3 3 3 5 1 3
2 
Explanation:
1 is a minima and 5 is a maxima hence there are 2 critical points

Sample 2:
Input
Output
7
1 2 3 2 1 3 2 
3
Explanation:
3rd node, 5th node and 6th node are the critical nodes, hence the answer is 3
