Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
You are given head of the non-empty sorted linked list where the value of the ith node will be Ai.
Your task is to delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once and return the linked list sorted.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line contains one integer N — the length of the linked list.
The second line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,…AN — the value of the linked list nodes starting from the head for the linked list.
Note:

I will use JAVA language. You can choose any of the languages.

Don't need for the constraints just practice using bruteforce method.


Sample 1:
Input
3

5
1 1 6 8 8

5
1 2 3 4 5

4
5 5 5 5

output
1 6 8 

1 2 3 4 5 

5 


Explanation:
Test case 1: We will remove duplicate entry of 1 and 8.

So the sorted linked list will be 

1→6→8.

Test case 2: There is no duplicate entry. So the sorted linked list will be 
1→2→3→4→5.

Test case 3: We will remove duplicate entry of 5
5. So the sorted linked list will be 
5
